## Words for Devs
If you're familiar with basic Julia workflow, check out the [documentation](https://moelf.github.io/WVZAnalysis.jl/dev)
directly.

## New to Julia:
- Download Julia 1.7 or above, we recommend 1.8 or above
    - if you have access to `/cvmfs`, you can also access Julia via LCG release:
```
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/dev4/latest/x86_64-centos7-gcc11-opt/setup.sh
```

- We recommend lauching Julia via `julia --project=<path to this repo folder>`, this is because
you may want to use `Manifest.toml` to keep exact versions of packages including all dependencies.

- You should `]instantiate` or `]up` if you manually pulled this repo or the first time colneing it.
